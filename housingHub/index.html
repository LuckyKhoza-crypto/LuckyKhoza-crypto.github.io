                    The goal of our project was to create a way for all students to have easy, equal, and affordable access to off campus
                    housing and off campus housing information. We recognize that around the country, there is an inequality for housing
                    opportunity, whether it's in the form of affordable housing, location of housing, or even knowing the state's laws 
                    for tenants and real estate agents. We had a goal of making all that information clear and concise, and in one easy
                    location for all students who are looking for off campus housing, or simply want to learn more about housing laws
                    and regulations when it comes to renting and buying houses.
